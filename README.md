# RADAR-SYSTEM-WITH-OBSTACLE-DETECTION
The Radar System with Obstacle Detection project involved the development and implementation of a radar-based system designed to detect obstacles in real-time. The project encompassed hardware and software integration to create a robust detection mechanism using radio waves to identify objects position and distance.
